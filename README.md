# Jenkins Pipeline Example

### Goal

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate with a simple project how a software delivery pipeline can be assembled using Jenkins.

Some important steps can be seen in this project, such as unit testing, interface testing, static code analysis, and deploying Docker images.

A pipeline can contain more or less steps depending on your application scenario. The important thing is to understand the flow needed to deliver the application with confidence, and to automate this flow.

Use this project as a base for ideas for your own pipeline.

### How to use

Having Docker and Maven installed, execute the commands below:

```
git clone git@github.com:robsonbittencourt/jenkins-pipeline-example.git

cd jenkins-pipeline-example

mvn clean package

docker-compose up -d
```

After that some services will be available:

**App Products DSV** - http://localhost:8081

Simple app in DSV stage

**App Products UAT** - http://localhost:8085

Simple app in UAT stage

**App Products PRD** - http://localhost:8090

Simple app in PRD stage

**Docker Registry** - http://localhost:5000

A local Docker Registry to publish images

**Jenkins** - http://localhost:8080

Jenkins to run CI and CD jobs.

**Sonarqube** - http://localhost:9000

Sonarqube is a tool that performs static code analysis and points out possible problems.

**Selenium Grid** - http://localhost:4444/ui/index.html#/

Selenium grid allow run UI Selenium tests in a Docker environment

If you want to see tests running on browser access http://localhost:7900. The password is `secret`.

When accessing Jenkins there are two jobs already configured: 

#### products-ci
Run this job to build, test, analyse code, and running app in DEV environment

- Download the project from Github
- Run unit-tests
- Execute Sonarqube analysis
- Build jar artifact
- Build and deploy Docker image with DEV tag
- Run docker container using DEV tag

#### products-cd
This job update UAT environment, running UI tests and make deploy on PRD environent

- Download the project from Github
- Build and deploy Docker image with UAT tag
- Run docker container using UAT tag
- Run interface tests in UAT stage
- Build and deploy Docker image with PRD tag
- Run docker container using PRD tag


### Possible issues

If you have permission problem to execute docker commands during Jenkins Pipeline, running command bellow:

```
sudo chmod 666 /var/run/docker.sock 
```
